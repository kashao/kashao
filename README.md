My story:

I always enjoy exploring and tinkering with various things. When I discovered web development, I thought it would be great to create simple and easy-to-understand website tutorials.

When I encountered bots on Discord, I wondered if I could develop my own bot to make my life more convenient and add some fun to it.

However, I do have a tendency to succumb to laziness. Either I spend too much time on a project or forget where I left off, haha!

Nevertheless, I want to start documenting my experiences and hope that it will help me in my personal growth.
